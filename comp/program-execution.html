		<h1 class="heading">1	Program Execution</h1>
		<p>
		Program Execution describes how a computer runs the instructions of a program.
		This involves compilation of the program and then the various techniques used 
		to effectively run it
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2 class"section">1.1	Overview</h2>
		<h3 class="subsection">1.1.1	Program</h3>
		<p>
		The program refers to the sequence of instructions that are to be fed into
		the processing units in order for to get the computer to perform the desired tasks.
		The program is the term for the abstraction of the instructions with the source code
		and executable binary being different forms of the program. 
		</p>		
		<h3 class="subsection">1.1.2	Process</h3>
		<p>
		The process is the instantiation of a program. It refers specifically to the
		execution of the program instructions in memory. A process is carried out by one or many threads.
		Concurrency(multithreading) refers to multiple threads executing the same process while multitasking
		is the concurrent execution of multiple processes.
		</p>
		<h3 class="subsection">1.1.3	Thread</h3>
		<p>
		The thread is the smallest unit of execution that can be managed by a scheduler. Many processes are
		executed concurrently meaning that multiple threads are used to run the same process. This allows a
		process to perform multiple tasks at once by having each thread share memory within the PCB.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2 class="section">1.2 Execution</h2>
		<p>Once a program has been conceived it will be written in a high level language, complied 
		into an object file and then linked to form a binary file. The binary file consists of a 
		lines of machine code which will be executed with the instruction cycle(fetch-decode-execute).
		In order for a program to run on a system it must interface with the system's application
		binary interface (ABI). 
		</p>
		<p>
		The program starts executing from the entry point after which it simply follows the 
		given instructions through. This state is termed run-time which is the final stage in
		the program lifecycle. An executing program can have multiple threads which carry out the
		execution, these threads are managed by the scheduler which, through preemption, switches
		between different threads depending on priority enabling multithreading. This switching is
		known as context switching.
		</p>
		<p>
		An operating system with multitasking must have a system of process states as two instructions
		can not be executed simultaneously. The states are kernel specific however they share functionality.
		</p>
		<p>
		They are as follows:
		<li>Created - The program is loaded from secondary storage to main memory
		<li>Waiting - The process waits for a context switch
		<li>Running - The process has its next instructions exectured by the processor
		<li>Blocked - The process cannot be executed as it waits for input
		<li>Terminated - The process has finished running
